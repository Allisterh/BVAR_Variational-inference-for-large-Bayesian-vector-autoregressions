# Variational-Bayes-for-multivariate-predictive-regressions

This folder contains the main paper [Bernardi, Bianchi, and Bianco (2022)] and the code to perform variational Bayes inference for multivariate predictive regressions with continuous shrinkage priors. 

A simple R code named TestCode.R is provided together with the source package VBmlr_1.0.tar.gz.
