# Variational inference for large Bayesian vector autoregressions

This folder contains the main paper [Bernardi, Bianchi, and Bianco (2022)] and the code to perform variational Bayes inference for large Bayesian vector autoregressiomns (and more in general multivariate predictive regressions) with continuous shrinkage priors. 

A simple R code named TestCode.R is provided together with the source package VBmlr_1.0.tar.gz (old version).
